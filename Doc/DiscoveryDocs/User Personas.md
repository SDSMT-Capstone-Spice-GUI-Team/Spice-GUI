## How to Create Personas

### Research Methods
1. **User Interviews** - Talk to 5-10 real/potential users per persona
2. **Surveys** - Gather quantitative data from larger groups
3. **Analytics** - Review usage patterns from existing users
4. **Customer Support Data** - Common questions and pain points
5. **Sales Team Input** - What do prospects ask about?
6. **Observation** - Watch users work (if possible)

### Best Practices
- **Base on real data** - Not assumptions or stereotypes
- **Keep it focused** - 3-5 primary personas maximum
- **Make them specific** - Vague personas aren't useful
- **Update regularly** - Users evolve, so should personas
- **Share widely** - Everyone on the team should know them
- **Reference in decisions** - "Would Sarah find this valuable?"

### Red Flags (Avoid These)
- ❌ Creating too many personas (spreads focus too thin)
- ❌ Personas based on internal assumptions, not research
- ❌ Demographic details without behavioral insights
- ❌ Creating personas then never using them
- ❌ Confusing user roles with personas (they're different!)

## Using Personas in Development

### In Product Planning
- "Would this feature help Sarah achieve her goals?"
- "Is this aligned with Marcus's technical skill level?"

### In Design Reviews
- "Can Sarah complete this task in under 3 clicks?"
- "Would this terminology confuse David?"

### In Sprint Planning
- "This story addresses Sarah's #1 pain point - high priority"
- "Marcus would never use this - consider deprioritizing"

### In User Story Writing
**As** Sarah (Operations Manager)  
**I want to** automatically sync data between systems  
**So that** I can eliminate 5 hours/week of manual data entry

## Persona vs User Role

**User Role** = Job function (Admin, Editor, Viewer)
- Defines permissions and access
- Technical/system-oriented

**Persona** = Rich profile of a type of user
- Defines needs, behaviors, context
- Human-oriented

*You might have one persona that uses multiple roles, or multiple personas with the same role.*
