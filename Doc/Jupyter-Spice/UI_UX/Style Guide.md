### Colors:
[Mines Color Visual Design](https://brand.sdsmt.edu/visual-design/colors/)
Note that the color usage guidelines are a great starting point for denoting color in the document. Another thing to note is light vs dark mode in the program. The visual design page does have black and greys in the neutral brand colors. Unless noted in this document these are the colors to use for dark mode. The 60-30-10 rule shows what the colors should be in light mode, and likewise the dark mode should reflect that.

### Fonts:
The current fonts that will be in use by SDM-Spice are:
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
- [OpenDyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org/)
The program should no matter what be able to choose a main font and a dyslexia friendly font, as we are trying to keep the ability to be accessibility friendly.
