Welcome to the **SDM Spice** (South Dakota Mines Spice) documentation wiki.

## About SDM Spice

SDM Spice is an open-source circuit design and simulation platform developed at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT). It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for designing electronic circuits and running SPICE simulations.

### Key Features
- Visual circuit schematic editor with drag-and-drop component placement
- 20+ components: passives, sources, dependent sources, semiconductors (BJT, MOSFET, diodes), switches
- Intelligent wire routing with automatic pathfinding
- Integrated ngspice simulation (DC OP, DC Sweep, AC Sweep, Transient, Temperature Sweep)
- Parameter sweep across component values
- Interactive waveform viewer with measurement cursors and result overlay
- FFT/harmonic analysis with THD calculation
- CSV, PNG, SVG, and PDF export
- SPICE netlist import (.cir/.spice files)
- Dark mode and configurable keyboard shortcuts
- Auto-save with crash recovery
- Undo/redo, copy/paste, multi-select
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
