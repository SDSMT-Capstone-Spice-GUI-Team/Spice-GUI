Title *A netlist must have a title to run properly. it could use the same name that the user named their circuit, or it could be a simple placeholder

*comments like this one are denoted by an asterisk. they are just for humans

*a netlist is essentially just a text file. however, they have to have a .cir file extension instead of .txt for ngspice to run them

*now we can start adding circuit elements. each element is denoted by a specific character and can be uniquely named by adding additional characters after this identifier

*elements also have node connections, for elements with polarities, the node in which the positive end is connect is listed first, and the negative connection is listed second
*nodes can be named whatever you want. these could be user input names, or just simple placeholders
*however, every circuit must have a node 0 which is ground. the user will denote this by placing the ground element on the node that they want to be ground

*elements also have user input parameters like the voltage of a voltage source or the resistance of a resistor
*the input parameters for each element are outlined in ElementParameters.txt

*lets construct a simple voltage divider to use as an example

*lets start with a voltage source
*we know from ElementParameters.txt that a DC voltage source follows form Vxxxxxxx PositiveNode NegativeNode DC VoltageValue

*lets name our voltage source Vinput, connect its positive end to node A and its negative end to ground (remember ground is node 0), and give it a voltage of 12v
*this looks like:

Vinput A 0 DC 12

*now to add some resistors
*we know from ElementParameters.txt that a resistor follows form Rxxxxxxx Node1 Node2 ResistanceValue

*lets name our first resistor Rapple, connect one end to node A and the other end to node B, and give it a resistance value of 2ohms
*this looks like:

Rapple A B 2

*lets name our second resistor Rorange, connect one end to B and the other to ground (node 0), and give it a resistance of 4 ohms
*this looks like:

Rorange B 0 4

*now that we've built the circuit, we need to select an analysis type. since this circuit isn't changing over time, we will select the operating point analysis
*additional analysis types and their input parameters (if applicable) are outlined in AnalysisTypes.txt

*the call for operating point analysis looks like:

.op

*now we need to actually run the simulation

*to run it we need to use the .control and run commands
*this looks like:

.control
run

*now we need to select what data we want shown and how we want it to be shown
*the data that can be output and the methods to show said output are outlined in OutputTypes.txt

*for this we will print our values since each point has only one output value with operating point analysis
*we will print the node voltage at our input node A, denoted v(A), and the node voltage at our output node B, denoted v(B)
*this looks like:

print v(A) v(B)

*now we will end the program using the .endc and .end commands
*this looks like:

.endc
.end

*Try It: if you have ngspice installed, change the file extension of this file to .cir and run the command: Source WhatsInANetlist.cir
*the ngspice command line should show the outputs: v(a)=12 and v(b)=8v
