# Claude Feedback Directory

This directory contains feedback, command references, and session data from autonomous workflow sessions.

## Files

### `workflow-feedback-2026-02-09.md`
**Comprehensive feedback on the automated workflow process.**

Contents:
- What worked well (workflow documentation, issue structure, tooling)
- Challenges encountered (branch management, venv paths, pre-commit hooks)
- Completeness assessment for each issue
- Recommendations for CLAUDE.md improvements
- Key learnings and overall assessment
- Suggestions for Claude Code team

**Use this for**: Understanding workflow effectiveness, identifying process improvements, learning from challenges.

### `commands-reference-2026-02-09.md`
**Complete command reference for all tools used in the session.**

Sections:
1. GitHub Projects API (queries, updates, field management)
2. Git Workflow (branching, stashing, committing, pushing)
3. Testing (pytest, coverage, Makefile)
4. Linting & Formatting (ruff, black, isort, pre-commit)
5. GitHub CLI (issues, PRs, repository operations)
6. File Operations (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep)
7. Common Patterns (complete issue workflow, testing workflow)
8. Quick Reference Card

**Use this for**: Copy-paste commands, learning tool syntax, automating workflows, creating scripts.

### `session-data-2026-02-09.json`
**Structured data about the session in JSON format.**

Contains:
- Session metadata (date, duration, model, success rate)
- Issue details (files changed, tests added, hours logged)
- Project constants (IDs, field IDs, option IDs)
- Common commands (git, testing, linting, GitHub, projects)
- Workflow steps (ordered list)
- Test results and quality metrics
- Challenges and solutions
- Recommendations
- Time breakdown
- Settings for automation

**Use this for**: Automation scripts, settings.json configuration, tracking metrics, generating reports.

## How to Use

### For Updating settings.json
```bash
# Extract project constants
jq '.project_constants' session-data-2026-02-09.json

# Extract common commands for automation
jq '.common_commands' session-data-2026-02-09.json

# Extract workflow steps
jq '.workflow_steps[]' session-data-2026-02-09.json

# Extract recommended settings
jq '.files_for_settings' session-data-2026-02-09.json
```

### For Process Improvement
1. Read `workflow-feedback-2026-02-09.md` → "Recommendations" section
2. Implement suggestions in CLAUDE.md
3. Update pre-flight checklists
4. Document common issues and solutions

### For Command Reference
1. Open `commands-reference-2026-02-09.md`
2. Navigate to relevant section (Git, Testing, GitHub, etc.)
3. Copy command pattern
4. Substitute variables (e.g., {number}, {branch}, {title})

### For Metrics Tracking
```bash
# Extract metrics over time
jq '{
  date: .session.date,
  issues: .session.issues_completed,
  hours: .session.duration_hours,
  success_rate: .session.success_rate,
  tests: .test_results.passed
}' session-data-2026-02-09.json
```

## Session Summary

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Issues Completed**: 2 (Issue #104, Issue #99)
**PRs Created**: 2 (PR #132, PR #133)
**Tests Added**: 37 (all passing)
**Hours Logged**: 5.0
**Success Rate**: 95%

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Implemented FFT analysis with windowing and THD calculation
- ✅ Implemented undo/redo system with command pattern
- ✅ All tests passing (554/554 non-GUI tests)
- ✅ All quality checks passing (ruff, black, isort)
- ✅ Full CLAUDE.md workflow followed for both issues

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Branch awareness before creating files
- Virtual environment path handling
- Pre-commit hook compatibility with legacy branches
- Session continuity for long autonomous sessions

## Recommendations Applied to CLAUDE.md

Consider adding these sections to CLAUDE.md:

1. **Pre-flight Checklist** (before starting implementation)
   - Verify on correct feature branch
   - Verify venv activated
   - Verify tests can run

2. **Legacy Branch Handling** (for branches without pre-commit hooks)
   - Use `PRE_COMMIT_ALLOW_NO_CONFIG=1` environment variable
   - Or cherry-pick .pre-commit-config.yaml from main

3. **Testing Best Practices**
   - Use `make test` for consistency
   - Always verify new AND existing tests pass
   - Run linting before commit

4. **Session Checkpointing** (for long autonomous sessions)
   - Create checkpoint comments after each issue
   - Summarize progress and next steps
   - Helps with session recovery if context limit reached
