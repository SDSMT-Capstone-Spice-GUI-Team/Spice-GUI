## 📌 Executive Summary
- Focused on **project groundwork**: GitHub workflow, backlog/issue setup, initial Qt scaffold.  
- Mentor emphasized:  
  - **Design-first** approach (avoid rushing to fragile prototypes).  
  - **Documentation** as the main deliverable (record *why* decisions were made).  
- Expectation: **10–15 hrs per person/week** (average).  
- Mentor traveling next week; October availability uncertain.

## ✅ Progress Since Last Week
- **Repo & Workflow**
  - Branching model designed (feature → PR → main).  
  - Backlog populated with initial issues.  
- **Codebase**
  - Initial Qt *canvas window* scaffold created (awaiting PR merge).  
  - Chose **Qt Widgets** over **Qt Quick** (less technical debt).  
- **Research**
  - Qt rendering methods; signals/slots.  
  - SPICE: netlists, structure, hardware/software segmentation.  

---

## 📊 Key Decisions
- **Design > Speed:** Spend time on architecture and options before coding.  
- **Documentation = Deliverable:** Capture rationale, constraints, quirks, trade-offs.  
- **Tools:** Obsidian OK for drafting, but final docs must be in GitHub.  
- **Capstone ambiguity:** No design doc template yet; mentor to raise with instructors.  

---

## ⚠️ Risks / Concerns
- No clear **documentation requirements** yet.  
- Mentor may be unavailable through October.

## 📌 Action Items
- [ ] Confirm PR status for Qt canvas window → **Jeremy**  
- [ ] Add **CONTRIBUTING.md** with branching/PR policy → **Dev Lead**  
- [ ] Draft **System Architecture v0.1** diagram → **Software team**  
- [ ] Create **ADR-001 (Qt Widgets vs Quick)** → **UI Lead**  
- [ ] Create **ADR-002 (SPICE integration)** → **EE team**  
- [ ] Set up `/docs` folder with structure:  
  - 01-Overview.md  
  - 02-Requirements.md  
  - 03-Architecture.md  
  - 04-UI-Wireframes.md  
  - 05-SPICE-Notes.md  
  - 99-ADRs/  
- [ ] Request official **Capstone design doc template** → **PM**  
- [ ] Backlog grooming: convert research → actionable issues  

---

## 🗓️ Timeline
- **This week:** Merge Qt scaffold, publish ADRs, set up `/docs`.  
- **Next 2 weeks:** Complete Architecture v0.1 + Requirements.  
- **Meetings:** No mentor meeting next week; tentative week after.

## 🔑 Takeaway
**Primary deliverable = Design Documentation (not prototype).**  
Focus on recording *why* decisions were made to build a strong foundation for future teams.
