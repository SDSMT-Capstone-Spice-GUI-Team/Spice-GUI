Example:

Printing the voltage at node A would look like:

Print v(A)



Plot:

Plot Data

Example:

Plotting the voltage at node C would look like:

Plot v(C)



Voltage at a Node:

v(NodeName)

Example:

Printing the voltage at node B would look like:

Print v(B)



Voltage Between Nodes:

v(PositiveNode,NegativeNode)

Example:

Plotting the voltage between nodes X and Y would look like:

Plot v(X,Y)



Current through a Voltage Source:

i(SourceName)

Example:

Printing the current through Vhat would look like:

Print i(Vhat)



Current through an Element:

@ElementName[i]

Example:

Plotting the current through R7 would look like:

Plot @R7[i]

*note: not supported for AC Sweep



Magnitude:

mag(x)

Example:

Plotting the magnitude of the voltage at node G would look like:

Plot mag(v(G))



Phase:

phase(x)

Example:

Plotting the phase of the voltage at node G would look like:

Plot phase(v(G))



Unwrapped Phase:

unwrap(phase(x))

Example:

Plotting the unwrapped phase of the voltage at node G would look like:

Plot unwrap(phase(v(G)))
