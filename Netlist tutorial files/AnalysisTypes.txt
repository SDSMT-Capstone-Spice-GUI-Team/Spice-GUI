Analysis Types

Operating Point:

.op

Example:

Performing operating point analysis would look like:

.op



Transient Analysis:

.tran StepSize StopTime

Example:

Performing transient analysis over 10ms with a step size of 100ns would look like:

.tran 100n 10m



AC Sweep:

.ac dec PointsPerDecade StartFrequency EndFreqency

Example:

Performing AC sweep analysis starting at 50Hz and ending at 5kHz with 100 points per decade would look like:

.ac dec 100 50 5k



DC Sweep:

.dc SourceName StartVoltage EndVoltage StepSize

Example:

Performing DC sweep analysis on a source named Vvar starting at 0V, ending at 20V, with a step size of 0.1V would look like:

.dc Vvar 0 20 0.1
